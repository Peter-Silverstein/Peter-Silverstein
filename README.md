# 🏙️ Data-Driven Sustainable Urban Policy Nerd 🏙️ 
Hello there! I'm a curious, data-driven researcher and analyst with quantitative skills in modeling, spatial analysis/mapping, and research design. I explore issues at the intersection of sustainable urbanism, specifically mass transit, housing policy, and green energy. Cities are not only the pinnacle of human civilization, they will also have an increasing importance in the rise of urbanization and the age of climate change.

Presently, I'm a master's student at Columbia University studying [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://qmss.columbia.edu) and [Public Administration](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/masters-programs/master-public-administration).
